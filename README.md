## What

In November 2017, Cern launched a competition to design an exhibit prototype for the LHC accelerator, explaining “why we do what we do” at Cern.

This repository contains information, design, schematics, drawings... concerning the award-winning project for this LHCreate 2017 hackathon at CERN's IdeaSquare.

## Why

Scientists, often fascinated by their very specific field of competence, easily end up in a delirium when trying to explain what they are actually doing. This results in an exciting subject like physics becoming extremely unclear for friends and family. This prototype aims at showing in an interactive way how accessible science really is.

## How

A heterogeneous mix of enthusiastic people, who never met each other before, have been put together in a blue container for two days. Ok, let's give them some names... Claudia, James,  Laura, Maëlys, Marina and Carl started brainstorming on the subject. After a couple of hours of crazy ideas from the physicists, engineers and IT'ers, they hit the brakes, and started involving their artistic designers. Now things really got moving. Finally, an interactive, scientifically correct exhibit, which also looked good, was born !
